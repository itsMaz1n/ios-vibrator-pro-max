# `ios-vibrator-pro-max`

Finally Safari added an unofficial™️ vibration API. I'm sorry to whoever who let this amazing feature/bug accidentally ship it's way into iOS 18. Tim cook please don't remove it, the web & PWAs need love too.

```ts
import "ios-vibrator-pro-max";

navigator.vibrate(2000);
```
